* GitHub Profile Main Page: https://atingupta2005.github.io/profile/

* I researched for creating my GITHub/Markdown resume on 23-Dec-2019 and came across a couple of interested projects as below:
* GitHub Projects which I selected for Resume Building
    * https://github.com/jagadeeshpalaniappan/jag-resume-builder
    * modern-resume-theme
    * resumecards
    * jag-resume-builder
    * best-resume-ever


* After researching all, I decided to prepare my plain resume on MarkDown. 
* I then used the project - https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume to create my resume. This project allows to convert the Markdown Resume to a variety of formats.
* I used Visual Studio Code to prepare MD resume.

* I then checked in this project to GitLab and also other projects I selected above.

* I then done the setup of MD resume using steps below:
* Setup Quick Portfolio on GitHub:
    * https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio

* My Resume repository is forked on the URL:
    * https://github.com/atingupta2005/profile.git


* My Final MD Resume Collections URL:
    * https://atingupta2005.github.io/profile/


* I also prepared the environment of all these projects in Docker and checked in the final Docker file to:
    * <>

* Next Steps:
1. Prepare Resume using - resumecards
1. Prepare MD resume such that it can be exported to Word Document without any distortion
1. Prepare various versions of my resume for different purposes - Training, Consultancy, Lotus Domino, Python etc.
1. Change my PP Pic
1. Prepare my MD resume using all selected GitHub projects
1. Create Small MD files to be reused in multiple profiles I created
1. Implement pandoc to automatically profile the Word profile links on my resume on github.io
